# Range-Calculator
A little calculator I made for ranging objects specifically for Arma 3

RangeCalc.java is in imperial units using inches for the reference and yards for the range and altitude 
RangeCalcMetric.java is in metric, using centimeters for the reference and meters for the range and altitude
RangeCalcHalfnHalf.java is a mix between metric and imperial, it uses inches for the reference and meters for the altitude and range

I have found for my American users that the HalfnHalf is the best for Arma 3 because all the ranges and altitudes in the game are in metric but i'm better at judging size in imperial
